Web service example

 Instructions on building and running a JiBX web service example.
 
* Example

 Step 1: Checkout the web service sample from our source repository. This example is very similar
 to the cxf web service example.
 
+-----+
 git clone git@github.com:jibx/schema-library.git
 cd schema-library/schema-utilities/examples/opentravel-webservice/opentravel-ping/opentravel-ping-service
 mvn clean install
+-----+

 Step 2: Download {{{http://www.fusesource.com/}Apache servicemix (fusesource distribution)}} and start it up.
 
+-----+
 tar zxvf apache-servicemix-x.x-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
 cd apache-servicemix-x.x.x-fuse-00-xx
 bin/servicemix
+-----+

 Step 3: Add the jibx repository and add the JiBX OSGi bundles.

+-----+
 features:install obr
 obr:addurl http://www.jibx.org/repository.xml
 obr:deploy 'Schema Library - org.opentravel.ping - 2011B - opentravel.org ping schema'
 install mvn:org.jibx.schema.org.opentravel.ws/org.jibx.schema.org.opentravel._2011B.ping.ws/1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
 (remember the Bundle ID)
 ctrl+d (stop servicemix)
 bin/servicemix (restart servicemix)
 start 222 (replace 222 with the Bundle ID displayed above)
+-----+

 Step 4: Load client.html (from the opentravel-ping-service project root directory) into your favorite browser
 and click 'send'. Most browsers will display the soap xml message returned from the web
 service (some will just display 'status: 0'). To see the wsdl from servicemix, {{{http://localhost:8092/Ping?wsdl}Click here}}.
 
That's it!
