Web Services Client

 This schema library includes a simple client framework for SOAP and RESTful web services.
 
 The client framework contains utility methods to send RESTful messages, wrap a message in a
 SOAP envelope and do testing. It's easy to send a messages and receive the response.
 
 Included in the client framework are utilities to manipulate and check namespace aware XML
 schema. You can easily convert your JiBX object tree to XML or DOM and back to JiBX.
 You can convert your XML
 using XSL Transformation. You can also search your XML trees using XPATH.
 
 These utilities make creating a web-services client quick and easy.
 
 These tools also make the client library the perfect toolbox to create your
 client test cases. The client library has a utility that can read XML message files from the
 local classpath storage and send them to your test service.

Client Web service example

 Before running this client test, you must have a Web Service running. Set up the
 {{{./service.html}Web Services example}} or create a {{{http://blog.tourgeek.com/2012/04/creating-soap-and-rest-services-for.html}soapui server}} before running this example.

* Running this example
 
 Step 1: Download the test hotel client from our github repository:
 {{{https://github.com/jibx/schema-library/tree/master/org.opentravel/_2012A/opentravel-ws/opentravel-hotel-ws-test-client}https://github.com/jibx/schema-library/tree/master/org.opentravel/_2012A/opentravel-ws/opentravel-hotel-ws-test-client}}.
 
 Step 2: Move to the project directory and invoke maven.

+-----+
 cd opentravel-hotel-ws-test-service
 mvn install
+-----+

 That's it. You should see some sample SOAP and REST requests and replies and some messages
 indicating that the test ran okay.
  
* Alternate testing method
 
 These tests may also be run in an OSGi container
 
  Step 1: If you are running the sample server, you already have and OSGi container up. Just type:

+-----+
 obr:deploy -s org.jibx.schema.org.opentravel._2012A.hotel.ws.test.client
+-----+

 Your test should run automatically.
